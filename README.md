# UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy? Webpage Development

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to enhance our UFO sightings webpage.  Originally, our webpage's UFO data could only be filtered by date of the event.  The current and more sophisticated version makes it possible to do more advanced searches for these sightings by including additional filters:

•	by city

•	by state

•	by country

•	by evidence shape

## Results
Performing a UFO data search on our improved webpage is quite easy and broad.  It is possible to search by no filters, by as little as one filter and as many as all.  Examples are:

### _Example 1._  Accessing data without entering any filters.
  To access all the sightings, all that is needed is to go to the website:

### _Example 2._  Accessing data with one filter.
  To access all sightings that had a "triangle" shape, for example, simply type in "triangle" in the Enter A Shape filter.

### _Example 3._  Accessing data with multiple filters.
  In this example, the sightings  for "light"  in "texas" were generated:

## Summary
The additional filters created for this webpage have made it a much more effective tool for accessing data about UFO sitings.  This webpage does have a few drawbacks.  There are currently no directions to the user on using this page.  The existing filter place holders may be confusing.  Also, it may not be intuitive that pressing Enter will generate the search after filters have been filled.  Finally, it may not be obvious that clicking on the upper words "UFO Sightings" will refresh the page.  

Recommendations for further webpage development would be to address these drawbacks.  Another recommendation is to add a dropdown menu to the shape filter.  Many users may not be aware of the different options, such as formation, fireball, chevron, etc.
