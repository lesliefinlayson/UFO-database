# UFO-Database

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to enhance our UFO sightings webpage.  Originally, our website's UFO data could only be filtered by date of the event.  The current and more sophisticated version makes it possible to do more advanced searches for these sightings by including additional filters:

•	by city

•	by state

•	by country

•	by evidence shape

## Results
Performing a UFO data search on our improved website is quite easy and broad.  It is possible to search by no filters, by as little as one filter and as many as all.  Examples are:

# _Example1._  Accessing data without entering any filters.
  To access all the sightings, all that is needed is to go to the website:

# _Example2._  Accessing data with one filter.
  To access all sightings that had a "triangle" shape, for example, simply type in "triangle" in the Enter A Shape filter.
